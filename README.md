# About ToF AR

ToF AR, Time of Flight Augmented Reality, is a toolkit library intended to aid in Unity application development for iOS and Android devices. It consists of a group of functionalities based on depth information from ToF / Lidar (light detection and ranging) sensor and so on.

As well as ToF AR, Unity and a compatible device with a ToF sensor are required to build and execute this sample application.

Please see [the ToF AR Site on Sony Developer World](https://developer.sony.com/develop/tof-ar) for ToF AR downloads and development guides, sample applications, and a list of compatible devices.
